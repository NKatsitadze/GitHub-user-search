# GitHub-user-search
This challenge seemed very easy at first, but when I dived in I found out it was not as easy, as it requited every css concept to be built correctly, so fortunately it was more fun than expected. Used grids and flexboxes for making this pixel perfect and responsive, used GitHub API for fetching users data and practiced with truthy and falsy values, used themeprovider of styled components for dark/light theme and made my first loading element, which is just a simple div with dashed border, that spins.
